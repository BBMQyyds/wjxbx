# Project Title

**"Questionnaire Star is not Star" College Satisfaction Questionnaire System**

## Project Introduction

The **"Questionnaire Star is not Star"** college satisfaction survey questionnaire system is a college satisfaction survey questionnaire system based on **SpringBoot+Vue**. The front-end and back-end are separated. The front-end uses the **Vue** framework, the back-end uses the **SpringBoot** framework, and the database uses **MySQL**. The front-end page uses the **ElementUI** component library, and the back-end uses the **MyBatis** framework for persistence operations. The project is built using **Maven**, **Junit** is used for unit testing, and **SonarQube** is used for code quality inspection. Use **Jmeter** for performance testing and **JaCoCo** for test coverage detection.

## Project Description

The application system for **"University Satisfaction Survey Questionnaire"** is meticulously designed to address the following business context:

- In recent times, traditional survey methods have assumed an increasingly pivotal role in statistical analysis across various industries. A substantial amount of data is collected through surveys and interviews.
- The need to delve deeper into the underlying requirements and circumstances of survey participants, and to conduct precise statistical analysis and research, necessitates the design and implementation of a questionnaire survey system.
- This system is grounded in internet technology, providing a robust platform for questionnaire design, distribution, statistical analysis, and content consolidation.

Traditional paper-based questionnaires are associated with high design and printing costs. Additionally, the preservation of paper questionnaires can be a cumbersome process. The distribution, collection, and statistical analysis of paper questionnaires is a complex operation, often resulting in issues such as missing or discarded questionnaires and statistical errors, which undermine the overall effectiveness of the survey process.

Leveraging internet-based survey questionnaire systems enables the efficient conduct of large-scale questionnaire surveys, significantly enhancing the objectivity of the survey results. It empowers surveyed individuals to respond to questionnaires without external influence, facilitates the digital storage of survey data, and offers the advantage of deployment within an intranet, ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive data. In comparison to conducting questionnaire surveys on commercial websites, this system provides an enhanced level of data security.

The system is thoughtfully designed with a B/S (Browser/Server) architecture, allowing access via mainstream web browsers on personal computers. It leverages popular development frameworks to construct server and client components and relies on mainstream databases for data persistence.

This project represents a pivotal step in enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the university satisfaction survey process.


## Project Requirements

1. **Java and Server Requirements:**
   - Develop the project using **JDK 1.8** or above.
   - Utilize **Tomcat 8** or a higher version.
   - Use **MySQL 5.7** or a newer version for development.

2. **Framework and Configuration:**
   - Implement the application using the **Spring Boot** open-source framework.
   - Configure the application using annotation-based configuration.
   - Build a **B/S (Browser/Server) architecture** application with relevant functionality.

3. **Project Build:**
   - Use **Maven** as the build tool for the project.

4. **Web Framework and Database Persistence:**
   - Employ popular web framework technologies such as **Vue** for the front-end (MVC framework).
   - Use **MyBatis** or similar database persistence frameworks for data operations.

5. **Character Encoding:**
   - Implement character encoding functionality using filters to ensure the system can handle non-English characters.

6. **Functional Testing:**
   - Conduct functional testing using **JUnit** to ensure system functionality.

7. **Code Quality Measurement:**
   - Use **SonarQube** to measure code quality and generate quality measurement reports.

8. **Test Case Coverage Measurement:**
   - Utilize **JaCoCo** to measure test case coverage and generate coverage reports.

9. **Database Connection Pool (Optional):**
   - Optionally, use an appropriate database connection pool, which can be **Tomcat's** built-in pool or third-party connection pool tools like **DBCP** or **C3P0**. Ensure security against SQL injection.

10. **Ajax and Asynchronous Processing (Optional):**
    - For enhanced user experience, implement asynchronous submission and partial page refresh using Ajax after the initial page load.
    - Use **JSON** format for Ajax data interactions.
    - Employ suitable third-party tools for object-to-JSON conversion, such as **Gson**, **Fastjson**, or **Jackson**.

11. **Performance Testing (Optional):**
    - Use **JMeter** for project performance testing.
    - Iteratively optimize performance and generate performance testing reports.
